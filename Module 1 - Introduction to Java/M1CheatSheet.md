# Cheat Sheet 

This cheat sheet contains the most important takeaways that lead up to section six.

## 1. Getting Started
    - class: contains all of your code.

    - main(): entry point of your app.

    - javac <file-name>.java: compiles your code.

    - java <file-name>: runs the compiled code.

## 2. Variables
Data types

There are 6 main data types.

| Data Type     | Value                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| int           | Whole numbers             |
| long          | Very large whole numbers  |
| double        | Decimals                  |
| String        | Text                      |
| char          | A single character        |
| boolean       | true or false             |

long can store very big numbers. But, int is faster and takes less memory.

| Variable Type | Amount of Memory (Bytes)  | Valid Range of Values             | 
| ------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| int           | 4                         | from: -2147483648                 |
|               |                           | to: 2147483647                    |
| long          | 4                         | from: -92233720336854775808       |
|               |                           | to: 92233720336854775807          |

| --       | Subtract One     | Decreases a value by 1              |
| +=       | Add By           | Increases the value by the          |
